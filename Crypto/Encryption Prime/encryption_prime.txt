Inspired by the concept of a basis of a vector space, Alice and Bob invented
yet another cryptosystem. This time they use an encoding Ξ, which first encodes each
letter to a predefined number. This number is equal to the index of the corresponding
letter in the English alphabet. For instance, the word Bob is encoded in a number array
[ 2, 15, 2 ].
Alice and Bob carefully chose a set of private keys K, they share as common preknowledge. Depending on the length of the message that should be sent, a distinct key is
used. Let’s define the key km ∈ K as the key used for encrypting messages with length
m.
Each key km is a m × m matrix, generated by the following rules:
• Each element of the matrix is either 0 or a prime number between 100 and 999.
• The row vectors of the matrix are linearly independent.
• There are exactly m numbers that are different from 0.
Now, the encryption E of a message M with length m is a straightforward procedure.
For example, let’s say that Alice encrypts this message M and sends it to Bob.
1. Alice encodes M, so she has Ξ(M).
2. Alice encrypts the encoded message with the corresponding key km, i.e.
E(Ξ(M), km) = km ∗ Ξ(M).
